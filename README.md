CCTV Surveillance of Multiple Locations
This project demonstrates a CCTV surveillance system for multiple locations using JavaScript, Node.js, and FFmpeg. It streams RTSP feeds from multiple cameras and serves them as HLS streams via a web interface.

Project Structure
server.js: The main server script using Express to handle routes and start FFmpeg processes.
index.html: The web interface to display the camera streams.
styles.css: The CSS file for styling the web interface.
streams/: Directory to store the HLS stream files generated by FFmpeg.
Prerequisites
Node.js
FFmpeg
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cctv-surveillance.git
cd cctv-surveillance
Install the required Node.js packages:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Ensure FFmpeg is installed and accessible from the command line.

Usage
Create a streams directory in the project root:

bash
Copy code
mkdir streams
Update the RTSP URLs in server.js with your camera's RTSP stream URLs:

javascript
Copy code
const rtspUrls = [
    'rtsp://username:password@camera1_ip:port',
    'rtsp://username:password@camera2_ip:port',
    'rtsp://username:password@camera3_ip:port'
];
Start the server:

bash
Copy code
node server.js
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000/ to view the streams.

To start streaming from the cameras, hit the /start-streams endpoint:

bash
Copy code
curl http://localhost:8000/start-streams
File Descriptions
server.js
The server script using Express to handle routes and start FFmpeg processes for each camera:

Serves the web interface (index.html) and static files (styles.css).
Starts FFmpeg processes to convert RTSP streams to HLS format.
Serves the HLS streams from the streams directory.
index.html
The web interface to display the camera streams:

Uses the HLS.js library to handle HLS streams.
Displays video elements for each camera stream.
styles.css
The CSS file for styling the web interface:

Provides basic styling for the video elements and the overall layout.
Example
After starting the server and hitting the /start-streams endpoint, you should see the live camera feeds in your browser at http://localhost:8000/.
